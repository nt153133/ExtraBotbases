# ExtraBotbases
Llama Utilities botbase for RebornBuddy along with LL orderbot tags

## Installation

### Automatic Setup

The easiest way to install LlamaLibrary is to install the [repoBuddy](https://github.com/Zimgineering/repoBuddy) plugin. It would be installed in the **/plugins** folder of your rebornBuddy folder. It will automatically install the files into the correct folders.

### Manual Setup

For those of you that don't want to use [repoBuddy](https://github.com/Zimgineering/repoBuddy) here's the manual installtion method. 

First off, make sure you remove any previous versions of LlamaLibrary you may have in the **/BotBases** folder.

Download the zip from [ExtraBotbases](https://github.com/nt153133/ExtraBotbases) and create a folder in **/BotBases** called **ExtraBotbases** and either unzip the contents of the zip into that folder, or check out using a SVN client to that folder. These are a few extra botbases that most users will not use.
